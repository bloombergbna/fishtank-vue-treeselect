### Getting Started

It's recommended to install vue-treeselect via npm, and build your app using a bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

```bash
npm install --save @fishtank/vue-treeselect
```

This example shows how to integrate the fishtank vue-treeselect with your [Vue SFCs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html).

```vue
<!-- Vue SFC -->
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <FishtankTreeSelect
      :options="options"
      :max-height="null"
      :hide-control="true"
      :dropdownpopover="false"
      :multiple="true"
      :collapse-menu-padding="true"
      v-model="value" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  // import the component
  import FishtankTreeSelect from '@fishtank/vue-treeselect'
  // import the styles
  import '@fishtank/vue-treeselect/dist/vue-treeselect.css'

  export default {
    // register the component
    components: { Treeselect },
    data() {
      return {
        // define default value
        value: null,
        // define options
        options: [ {
          id: 'a',
          label: 'a',
          children: [ {
            id: 'aa',
            label: 'aa',
          }, {
            id: 'ab',
            label: 'ab',
          } ],
        }, {
          id: 'b',
          label: 'b',
        }, {
          id: 'c',
          label: 'c',
        } ],
      }
    },
  }
</script>
```

### Browser Compatibility

- Chrome
- Edge
- Firefox
- IE â‰¥ 9
- Safari

It should function well on IE9, but the style can be slightly broken due to the lack of support of some relatively new CSS features, such as `transition` and `animation`. Nevertheless it should look 90% same as on modern browsers.
